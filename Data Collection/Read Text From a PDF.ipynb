The Machine\\nLearning Landscape\\nNot so long ago, if you had picked up your phone and asked it the way\\nhome, it would have ignored you—and people would have questioned your\\nsanity . But machine learning is no longer science fiction: billions of people\\nuse it every day . And the truth is it has actually been around for decades in\\nsome specialized applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR).\\nThe first ML application that really became mainstream, improving the\\nlives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the\\n1990s: the spam filter . It’ s not exactly a self-aware robot, but it does\\ntechnically qualify as machine learning: it has actually learned so well that\\nyou seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore. It was followed by\\nhundreds of ML applications that now quietly power hundreds of products\\nand features that you use regularly: voice prompts, automatic translation,\\nimage search, product recommendations, and many more.\\nWhere does machine learning start and where does it end? What exactly\\ndoes it mean for a machine to learn  something? If I download a copy of all\\nW ikipedia articles, has my computer really learned something? Is it\\nsuddenly smarter? In this chapter I will start by clarifying what machine\\nlearning is and why you may want to use it.\\nThen, before we set out to explore the machine learning continent, we will\\ntake a look at the map and learn about the main regions and the most\\nnotable landmarks: supervised versus unsupervised learning and their\\nvariants, online versus batch learning, instance-based versus model-based\\nlearning. Then we will look at the workflow of a typical ML project,\\ndiscuss the main challenges you may face, and cover how to evaluate and\\nfine-tune a machine learning system.\\nThis chapter introduces a lot of fundamental concepts (and jar gon) that\\nevery data scientist should know by heart. It will be a high-level overview'"

They branded this technique “deep learning”.\\nA deep neural network is a (very) simplified model of our cerebral cortex,\\ncomposed of a stack of layers of artificial neurons. T raining a deep neural\\nnet was widely considered impossible at the time,   and most researchers\\nhad abandoned the idea in the late 1990s. This paper revived the interest of\\nthe scientific community , and before long many new papers demonstrated\\nthat deep learning was not only possible, but capable of mind-blowing\\nachievements that no other machine learning (ML) technique could hope to\\nmatch (with the help of tremendous computing power and great amounts of\\ndata). This enthusiasm soon extended to many other areas of machine\\nlearning.\\nA decade later , machine learning had conquered the industry , and today it is\\nat the heart of much of the magic in high-tech products, ranking your web\\nsearch results, powering your smartphone’ s speech recognition,\\nrecommending videos, and perhaps even driving your car .\\nM a c h i n e  L e a r n i n g  i n  Y o u r  P r o j e c t s\\nSo, naturally you are excited about machine learning and would love to join\\nthe party!\\nPerhaps you would like to give your homemade robot a brain of its own?\\nMake it recognize faces?
